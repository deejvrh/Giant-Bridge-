1
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,416
IN LOVING MEMORY OF MOTHER

2
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,291
<i>The hemorrhage was severe.</i>

3
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:50,208
<i>-She has lost a lot of blood--</i>
<i>-Is my wife alive or not?</i>

4
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,833
<i>Sorry, we couldn't save her.</i>

5
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,875
<i>But your son is safe and healthy.</i>

6
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,291
<i>Jay, my son.</i>

7
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,833
<i>Music is a drug.</i>

8
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,708
<i>They say…</i>

9
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,041
<i>"Those with the gift of</i>
<i>music and rhythm…</i>

10
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,583
<i>have been touched by God."</i>

11
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,541
<i>But that's a lie.</i>

12
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,000
<i>Do you know</i>

13
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:46,208
<i>why those crazy people</i>
<i>like performing on stage?</i>

14
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,125
<i>Because they get</i>
<i>addicted to the applause.</i>

15
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:57,583
<i>This applause eventually</i>
<i>intoxicates their veins and nerves.</i>

16
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,416
<i>Their addiction to one drug</i>
<i>leads to another.</i>

17
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,583
{\an8}<i>Little by little, music will</i>
<i>take away everything from you.</i>

18
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,541
{\an8}<i>Among all the diseases</i>
<i>and among all the addictions,</i>

19
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,541
<i>the worst of all is… music!</i>

20
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,083
<i>This is Jay.</i>

21
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,375
<i>My Jay!</i>

22
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,333
<i>He is a singer and song writer.</i>

23
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,250
<i>He sings for me.</i>

24
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,666
<i>And he's deeply in love with me.</i>

25
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,666
<i>I'm Sophia.</i>

26
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,541
<i>Today is my big day.</i>

27
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,666
<i>My annual charity show's</i>
<i>big finale is about to start.</i>

28
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,458
You are making this, right?

29
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,000
Harry!

30
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,375
-Harry!
-The plan is very simple.

31
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,791
Dancers will exit from the left.
The lights will be off.

32
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,500
-Our winning designer--
-Sophia Singhania.

33
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,833
Sophia Singhania.

34
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,875
She'll go on stage and give a speech.

35
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,083
Sophie will give a speech?

36
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,750
Yes. She's the winner after all.

37
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,125
-She can't speak.
-What do you mean?

38
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,208
She's mute.

39
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,000
There's no need for a speech.

40
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,791
Her work does the talking.

41
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,708
Come on, guys!
Everybody, get ready!

42
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,125
-Three minutes! I want everyone on stage!
-Presenting on stage, Sophia Singhania!

43
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,708
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up!

44
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:27,250
<i>What can I say, Sophia?</i>

45
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:33,250
<i>I was shattered into a thousand fragments</i>

46
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:38,125
<i>You held me in a warm embrace, Sophia</i>

47
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:43,750
<i>And now, I've become whole again</i>

48
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:49,666
<i>You're the fire that brings warmth</i>

49
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,375
<i>Your love is all I need</i>

50
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:59,500
<i>To drive out all the darkness</i>

51
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:05,791
<i>You burn bright as a lamp</i>

52
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:12,208
<i>In your silence, Sophia</i>

53
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,166
<i>I listen to my mother tongue</i>

54
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,083
<i>Your eyes tell me stories, Sophia</i>

55
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:28,250
<i>You bring me solace</i>

56
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,458
Hold it correctly, man!

57
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,333
Hey, Jay! What's up?

58
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,125
-How many do you want?
-Two.

59
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,875
<i>This whole world was</i>
<i>created for you, Sophia.</i>

60
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,458
Just for you.

61
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:57,250
<i>When our fingers are intertwined, Sophia</i>

62
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:03,125
<i>I feel like I have</i>
<i>The world in the palm of my hand</i>

63
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:08,166
<i>When we lock lips, Sophia</i>

64
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:13,666
<i>I feel like the skies are at my feet</i>

65
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,208
<i>Sophia!</i>

66
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,875
<i>Sophia!</i>

67
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,500
<i>Sophia!</i>

68
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,125
<i>Sophia!</i>

69
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,791
<i>Sophia!</i>

70
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,458
<i>Sophia!</i>

71
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,333
<i>Sophia!</i>

72
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:36,250
<i>Sophia…</i>

73
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,458
Oh! Deep within me!

74
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,500
Check, check!

75
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,708
And what's this? Oh!

76
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,541
<i>Yeah! Who is your daddy?</i>

77
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,208
<i>Yeah! Who is your daddy?</i>

78
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,208
{\an8}<i>Who is your daddy?</i>

79
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,375
<i>Who is your daddy?</i>

80
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,666
Love it!

81
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,125
-Sanju Singhania.
-I'm Jay.

82
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,458
It's an honor, sir.

83
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,166
Sophie's Jay.

84
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,041
Finally, we meet!

85
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,208
Please have a seat.

86
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,041
If I knew you had so much fun here,

87
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,041
I'd skip work every day
and come here instead.

88
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,291
-Anytime, sir.
-I mean, does all this gear

89
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,666
belong to you?

90
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,000
There's a secret behind that.

91
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,541
Tell me more.

92
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,083
-<i>Dandiya.</i>
-No!

93
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,041
Throughout the year, we play
at festivals and weddings.

94
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,791
We buy the gear by
performing at various events.

95
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,291
Amazing!

96
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,708
-Have you completed your graduation?
-Yes, a few years ago.

97
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,291
I'm doing my Masters now.

98
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,333
-What's your major?
-Music Technology.

99
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,083
Technology!
It looks like you're into it.

100
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,791
Music.

101
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,041
-Sir, sorry to disturb you.
-Yeah?

102
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,000
There are four
missed calls from Mr. Parekh.

103
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,958
-I gotta take this call.
-Sir.

104
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,250
-We gotta hang. You and me.
-Thank you, sir.

105
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,000
-We gotta spend some alone time.
-Thanks.

106
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,583
Give me that phone.

107
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,166
Parekh! I love you, baby.

108
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,625
You know I love you.

109
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,166
Bro, listen up!

110
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,000
That's G-Medal, right?

111
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,916
Hey, Sophie! This is for you.

112
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,875
The winning band is going to get
the headline slot at graduation.

113
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,916
There are no auditions.

114
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,958
-We just have to upload a song.
-What song?

115
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,541
-Don't you have one?
-But which song?

116
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,375
You write many songs.
Just send one of those.

117
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,958
I don't have song that will
help us win this competition.

118
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,291
Just send any song!
I know we'll be selected.

119
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,750
You get one decent song
after writing a hundred songs.

120
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,833
And you probably have a thousand songs!

121
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,458
-It's our time to shine.
-Ball, please!

122
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,875
Hey, chinki!

123
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,708
Could you please pass the ball?

124
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,083
-Thank you, sahebji.
-Listen…

125
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,000
-Yeah!
-Ignore them.

126
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,416
It's our graduation.

127
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,000
We must perform on stage together.
It'll be our first time.

128
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,166
I don't know, man!

129
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,291
We may not get another chance…

130
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,875
-Hey, Jackie Chan!
-Bro!

131
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,333
Chop Suey!

132
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,166
Hey, Changi!

133
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,833
Thank you!

134
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,458
Thank you, Changi!

135
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,916
-What…
-Hey, Jay!

136
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,041
Listen to me. You have that
old album with you, right?

137
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,500
The first two tracks
in that album are really good.

138
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,000
We'll send that first.
We have got to do this.

139
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,083
Listen to me, Jay. Ignore them!

140
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,541
Please let go.

141
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,708
Hey! Jay, stop it!

142
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,083
Jay, what are you doing? Stop it!

143
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,291
Damn you!

144
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,125
Thanks for that, man.

145
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,083
Anything for you, dude.

146
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,708
Well, then, send the song.

147
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,125
Which song?

148
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,750
The song you sang yesterday. It was cool.

149
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,166
That won't help us win.

150
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,666
<i>This is where we've talked and laughed</i>

151
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,083
<i>Right here</i>

152
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,708
<i>We leaned on our friend's shoulder</i>

153
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,625
<i>Right here</i>

154
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,291
<i>Tomorrow may be uncertain</i>

155
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,000
<i>But we don't dwell on sadness</i>

156
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:24,166
<i>Music is the voice of friendship</i>

157
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,125
<i>It'll be in our memories forever</i>

158
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,750
<i>There's no other place like this</i>

159
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,916
<i>It teaches us the way of life</i>

160
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,416
<i>It gives us wings to fly</i>

161
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,541
<i>I would never want this dream to end</i>

162
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,541
Next up, The Momos!

163
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:51,000
<i>Oh, tomorrow!</i>

164
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,125
<i>Hey, tomorrow!</i>

165
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:58,083
<i>The sun will shine brighter tomorrow</i>
<i>The future is ours</i>

166
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,833
<i>This is just the beginning of a journey</i>

167
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,166
<i>Our names will be etched in these walls</i>

168
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,833
<i>There will be stories</i>
<i>Behind every scribbling</i>

169
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,791
<i>We just want our friends by our side</i>

170
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:15,833
<i>For this is the only time</i>
<i>We truly live our lives</i>

171
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,791
<i>Oh, tomorrow!</i>

172
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,250
<i>Hey, tomorrow!</i>

173
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,333
<i>The sun will shine brighter tomorrow</i>
<i>The future is ours</i>

174
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,458
<i>This is just the beginning of a journey</i>

175
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,416
<i>There's love among us</i>
<i>There's anger among us</i>

176
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,208
<i>But our bond is beyond</i>
<i>Everything in this world</i>

177
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:40,416
<i>There's love among us</i>
<i>There's anger among us</i>

178
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,458
<i>But our bond is beyond</i>
<i>Everything in this world</i>

179
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,500
<i>Are you ready to sing out loud?</i>

180
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:50,083
<i>-Our first love</i>
<i>-We'll never forget!</i>

181
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,791
<i>-All our girlfriends</i>
<i>-We'll never forget!</i>

182
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,375
<i>-This beautiful day</i>
<i>-We'll never forget!</i>

183
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,791
<i>-The late night dance sessions</i>
<i>-We'll never forget!</i>

184
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,416
<i>-What about the library?</i>
<i>-We'll never forget!</i>

185
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,958
<i>-What about the canteen?</i>
<i>-We'll never forget!</i>

186
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,333
<i>-All the classes we bunked</i>
<i>-We'll never forget!</i>

187
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:15,375
<i>-All these beautiful memories</i>
<i>-We'll never forget!</i>

188
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,375
My father was right.

189
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,041
There's no drug like applause.

190
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,791
Say that after you try other drugs.

191
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,583
You're a rock star, man!

192
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,958
-Let's take a photo. Where's your family?
-Well…

193
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,333
-Hey…
-Right here.

194
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,791
Come on. Let's do this.

195
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,625
Mr. Singhania, please smile!

196
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,208
Oh, man!

197
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,875
I had no idea that
you're such a rock star!

198
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,750
I love it. I'm blown away.

199
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,458
This weekend…

200
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,625
I have some people coming over.

201
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,125
I want you to be there.

202
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,041
You'll be my guest of honor.

203
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,000
You'll be the man of the moment.

204
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,666
We'll party!

205
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,291
She's waiting for you. Go on.

206
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,916
Get out of here!

207
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,250
<i>Hey, tomorrow!</i>

208
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,083
<i>The sun will shine brighter tomorrow</i>
<i>The future is ours</i>

209
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,208
<i>This is just the beginning of a journey</i>

210
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,458
<i>Your story always seemed strange to me.</i>

211
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,791
There's no need for that.

212
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,625
You could have died last night.

213
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,708
You know that, right?

214
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,875
I don't know why, but I had
a feeling that I should keep this safely.

215
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,833
Your story is very interesting.

216
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:38,791
<i>To me, you're an angel in disguise</i>

217
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:43,500
<i>You have captivated me</i>

218
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:48,541
<i>You have taught me the language</i>
<i>Of music through your eyes</i>

219
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:53,083
<i>The moment I saw you</i>

220
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,541
<i>I knew I was yours</i>

221
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,875
Mr. Singhania's daughter's
performance is beautiful!

222
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,875
Both the performances are beautiful.

223
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,875
<i>Your painting and my music</i>

224
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:07,625
<i>Have been intertwined</i>

225
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,583
<i>Our world is a land</i>

226
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,250
<i>Of a thousand rainbows</i>

227
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:21,583
<i>It's a song</i>

228
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,875
<i>That is heard by none</i>

229
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:31,083
<i>I now see things through your eyes</i>

230
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,833
<i>Your eyes are full of language</i>

231
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:40,458
<i>It is the language of my music</i>

232
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,333
<i>Your visage is as beautiful</i>

233
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,875
<i>As a blooming lotus</i>

234
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:06,625
<i>You are the reason for my smile</i>

235
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:13,791
<i>You are the reason for my smile</i>

236
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,666
<i>You are the reason</i>

237
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,291
<i>For my smile</i>

238
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,708
If this continues,
you can make a lot of money.

239
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,333
Actually… no!

240
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,583
More than the one
who makes the music,

241
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:52,000
the one who brings it
to the market earns more.

242
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,541
Do I have to tell you this?

243
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,166
Let me give you an example.

244
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,833
He sings a song,

245
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,208
and we will buy that.

246
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,333
-We'll release it under his name…
-Jay!

247
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,583
-and make money out of it.
-Come here for a second.

248
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,333
Let's put it this way.

249
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,208
I would like you to meet the Honorable
Chief Minister, Mr. Prabhakar.

250
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,125
I would like to call you a friend.

251
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,000
He's very keen to get to know you.

252
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,958
Nice to meet you, sir.

253
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,791
The song you just performed
started with a fugue…

254
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,583
right?

255
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,708
Oh! So, you know about it.

256
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,208
I started the…

257
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,750
Classical Music Appreciation Club
at Delhi University.

258
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,458
I especially like JS Bach's fugues…

259
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,208
that have feeling.

260
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
I'm glad you liked my song, sir.

261
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,458
When did I say I liked it?

262
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,333
Music either reflects
reality or it doesn't.

263
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,750
Your music is good.

264
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,750
It will also reflect reality someday.

265
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,958
-Good luck!
-Thank you, sir.

266
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:00,916
-A drink?
-No, sir.

267
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,375
A rock star who doesn't drink!
You're really one of a kind.

268
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,833
Cheers!

269
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,541
So…

270
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,083
You love Sophie?

271
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,208
Very much, sir.

272
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,916
What are you willing to do for your love?

273
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,375
Sophia and I wish to get married.

274
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,625
How easy it is for the unmarried

275
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,500
to say that they want to get married!

276
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,375
That's a waste of time!

277
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,541
-Do you doubt my intentions--
-No. I don't doubt you.

278
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,041
Sophie must have chosen you
because she saw something in you.

279
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,208
She may be unable to speak,

280
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,041
but she understands everything.

281
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:46,500
She knows why I asked you to come here.

282
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:49,625
Jay…

283
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,583
I want to give India

284
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:55,458
a new means of listening to music.

285
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,625
I want to start an AI streaming service.

286
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,541
It's a brand new technology…

287
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,791
that goes into your phone, into
your tablet, into your computer…

288
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,416
and into your mind.

289
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:10,541
But I need someone to lead this.

290
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,416
I want you to do it.

291
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:20,083
Together, we will make it happen.

292
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,375
I'm totally convinced…

293
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,291
that I want you.

294
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,541
It would be an honor, sir.

295
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,375
-But…
-You're practically family.

296
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,583
Come on!
Whom else am I going to ask?

297
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,750
Sir, with all due respect…

298
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,250
I want to do something else.

299
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,500
What do you want to do?

300
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:51,125
-Music.
-Hey, I'm also talking about music.

301
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,750
But I don't look at music as a business.

302
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,083
It's all music.
It's all connected with music.

303
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:00,458
I want to be a musician, sir.

304
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:06,166
I want to write my own lyrics,
compose music and perform.

305
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:09,083
How will you make a living?

306
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,041
What do you mean, sir?

307
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,833
Sophie and I have lot of dreams, sir.

308
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,291
We wish to travel the world

309
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,000
for a few years.

310
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,083
I want to write songs

311
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,666
and perform live gigs.

312
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,375
Sophie can explore her passion,
which is art and dance.

313
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:30,583
We just want to travel for a while.

314
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,666
Explore ourselves. Find ourselves.

315
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,333
There's something between us, sir.

316
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,625
Oh… it's magic!

317
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,541
-You feel like it's magic!
-It's something magical.

318
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,625
It's… like a poem.

319
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,583
You'll walk into the sunset.

320
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,666
Hand in hand.

321
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,458
Come on!

322
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,791
Look around you.

323
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Look where you're sitting right now.

324
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,750
I have toiled to get to this position.

325
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,833
And I have raised Sophie with great care.

326
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,208
Why should I permit some struggling
artist to marry my daughter?

327
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,750
I promise you, sir.

328
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,333
I'll always keep her happy.

329
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,416
How?

330
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:25,458
Will you perform

331
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,333
at a <i>dandiya</i> event?

332
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,000
Do you ave any idea

333
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,500
how much the families of artists

334
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,291
have to struggle,

335
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,458
in the name of art?

336
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:37,083
All in the name of art!

337
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:40,375
Because you artists can only

338
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:42,583
love yourselves.

339
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,916
Sir, I believe…

340
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,250
music can change lives.

341
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,875
Just one song…

342
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:54,916
can change the whole world.

343
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:59,375
One song can change the world!

344
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:04,208
And… drum roll!

345
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,458
You have that song!

346
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:09,291
You have composed that song.

347
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,708
I'm in the presence…

348
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,041
of true art.

349
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,916
Let me hear it.

350
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:17,833
Come on, let me hear it.

351
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:19,333
Hit me, come on!

352
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,208
I want to hear it.

353
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,208
Where is the song?

354
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,125
I'm all ears, son. I'm all ears.

355
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,166
Do you have a song like that?

356
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'll tell you.

357
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:36,250
You want to become a musician.

358
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,666
So, compose good music first.

359
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,875
Why just one song?

360
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:45,500
Compose a hundred songs.
And then, we'll see…

361
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:50,041
whether your song can
change the world or not.

362
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:54,500
Until then, don't even think
about meeting or talking to Sophie.

363
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,125
That's my offer.

364
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:02,083
Do you love Sophie deeply enough?

365
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,791
A hundred songs!

366
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,791
<i>I have raised Sophie with great care.</i>

367
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:28,041
<i>Why should I permit some struggling</i>
<i>artist to marry my daughter?</i>

368
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,916
<i>Because you artists can only</i>

369
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,708
<i>love yourselves.</i>
<i>Where is the song?</i>

370
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:37,583
<i>You have composed that song.</i>
<i>One song can change the world!</i>

371
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:39,875
<i>Do you have a song like that?</i>
<i>Where is the song?</i>

372
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,333
<i>Until then, don't even think</i>
<i>about meeting or talking to Sophie.</i>

373
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,916
<i>Music has ruined our family.</i>

374
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:20,833
<i>Why just one song?</i>

375
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,583
<i>Compose a hundred songs.</i>

376
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:36,291
Go inside and choose
your birthday present.

377
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:38,750
Go on.

378
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:58,875
Where did you find this, son?

379
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:01,708
Prepare the bill.

380
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,708
Hey, where did you find this?

381
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:09,416
You've made a good choice, boy.

382
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,333
-We don't want that.
-Buy it. The strings are free.

383
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,375
Two hundred and eighty-seven…

384
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,708
We don't want it.

385
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:21,333
Sir, it's not for you. The boy
wants it. It's a child's guitar.

386
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,250
I said, we don't want it!

387
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,000
Hey!

388
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:30,458
Selling this guitar won't pay my bills.

389
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:33,166
We're insisting because the boy likes it.

390
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,458
We'll give you a 20% discount. That's it!

391
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,458
He talks just like my father.

392
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,708
You love Sophie, don't you?

393
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,916
Why don't you just elope with her?

394
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,458
Why do you need his permission?

395
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,916
No, that will be wrong.

396
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,416
It's the 21st century, man!

397
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Maybe, even 22nd!

398
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:30,791
I won't do that.

399
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:38,791
That means
you're going to write the songs!

400
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,583
A hundred songs!

401
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:46,166
If that's your final decision…

402
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,166
then come with me.

403
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:50,958
Where?

404
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,000
Shillong, bro.

405
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,791
The best place on earth.

406
00:30:58,333 --> 00:30:59,875
Especially to write songs.

407
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,541
You were made for Shillong.

408
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,250
We'll record a hundred songs

409
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,583
and throw them in his face.

410
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:10,666
What do you say?

411
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:24,083
<i>I've hidden a tune</i>
<i>for you in this tiny box.</i>

412
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,458
<i>Whenever you hear it,</i>

413
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,083
<i>you will know…</i>

414
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,416
<i>that there's music within me.</i>

415
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,083
<i>And that music…</i>

416
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:38,125
<i>is you, Sophie.</i>

417
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,291
<i>Don't ask why I am going away.</i>

418
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:49,916
<i>But I will come back for you…</i>

419
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,583
<i>and take you away.</i>

420
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,375
<i>And if I fail to do that…</i>

421
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,833
<i>then, maybe, I'm unworthy of you.</i>

422
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:17,583
<i>My life without you</i>

423
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:21,666
<i>Is like a flowerless garden</i>

424
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:25,291
<i>Why should I live without you?</i>

425
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,000
<i>Oh, my love!</i>

426
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:32,583
<i>Oh, my love!</i>

427
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:41,000
<i>My life without you</i>

428
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:44,875
<i>Is like a flowerless garden</i>

429
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,750
<i>Why should I live without you?</i>

430
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:52,041
<i>Answer me, my love</i>

431
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:56,208
<i>Oh, my love!</i>

432
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:02,125
<i>You are the essence of all my songs</i>

433
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,791
<i>You are my only desire</i>

434
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:11,875
<i>My longing is for you, only you</i>

435
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:19,416
<i>Without you, I am nothing</i>

436
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,000
<i>I'm a lone bird in the sky</i>

437
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:32,541
<i>I'm yearning for your presence</i>

438
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:38,625
<i>Without you, my wings are clipped</i>

439
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:48,125
<i>There are only tears in my eyes</i>

440
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:26,375
<i>You are my muse</i>

441
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:30,208
<i>Without you</i>
<i>There's a storm inside of me so intense</i>

442
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:33,416
<i>You are my muse</i>

443
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,375
<i>Without you</i>
<i>There's a storm inside of me so intense</i>

444
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:46,458
<i>My life without you</i>

445
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:50,041
<i>Is like a flowerless garden</i>

446
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,166
<i>Why should I live without you?</i>

447
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,583
<i>Answer me, my love</i>

448
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:01,208
<i>Oh, my love!</i>

449
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:36,208
<i>All my dreams, all my desires</i>

450
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:40,250
<i>Begin and end with you</i>

451
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,375
<i>All my dreams, all my desires</i>

452
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,166
<i>Begin and end with you</i>

453
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,041
<i>Now that you're not in my sight</i>

454
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:57,750
<i>My world has lost its daylight</i>

455
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:03,791
<i>I have a longing for peace</i>

456
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:11,333
<i>I'm alone in the wilderness</i>

457
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:21,791
Emily!

458
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,166
Esther!

459
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,541
Uncle Kong!

460
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,791
Grandma!

461
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,500
Is it Sunday today?

462
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,583
Hey!

463
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:43,958
Hey, my hair!

464
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,833
Okay!

465
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,958
What is this? Dad, look.

466
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:54,458
My sister Pauline has come back!

467
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:56,041
How are you, son?

468
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:58,750
Christopher, Daphne, Emily, Esther.

469
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,541
Emilia and my Pops.

470
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,875
This is the weirdo.

471
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,666
And this is the queen of
our house, our Grandma!

472
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,083
-God bless you.
-Hi!

473
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,458
-This is my cute mother.
-Hello.

474
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:12,291
She's the source of all
the cuteness in the world.

475
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:14,708
-Hello.
-Hello.

476
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:17,041
And this is Humpy.

477
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:20,125
Humpy? Why Humpy?

478
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,333
You'll find out soon.

479
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,541
That's Uncle Kong.

480
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,375
-Hello.
-Uncle Kong has seven kids.

481
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,083
Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Da, Ne.

482
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,625
One is on the way.

483
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,875
They're aiming for an octave!

484
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:36,250
Yeah!

485
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:38,458
This is my family.

486
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:41,208
By the way, guys, this is Jay.

487
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,375
-Amen.
-Amen.

488
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:57,291
-Tell us that story.
-I have an embarrassing story of Polo.

489
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,458
Hey, shut up! Not right now.

490
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,083
What is that? Jimi?

491
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,750
On T-shirt its written Jimi, Jimi.

492
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,958
-Hendrix?
-Is there another Jimi?

493
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:07,500
Do you know Hendrix?

494
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:08,791
Who doesn't know Hendrix?

495
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:10,541
Fine. Sing me a Hendrix song.

496
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,250
-Yeah.
-Which song do you know?

497
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,666
Who doesn't know Jimi Hendrix!

498
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,500
Tell me.
Was he a left-handed guitarist

499
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:16,916
or a right-handed guitarist?

500
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,875
Left-handed or right-handed?

501
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,541
All guitarists are righties!

502
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:27,583
Everyone except you knows that.

503
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:30,458
Look, wearing a Jimi Hendrix T-shirt

504
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,916
-doesn't make you Jimi Hendrix.
-Pappu.

505
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:36,125
I understand.

506
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:40,166
I know, dad.
That's why I became a drummer.

507
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,083
Right, Popo?

508
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,916
Why didn't you tell me?

509
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:34,125
What?

510
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,291
About your family…

511
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,250
and your home.

512
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,416
This is insane, bro!

513
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,708
They're all musicians.
Of course, they're insane.

514
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:49,333
You're just like them!

515
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:50,958
I know.

516
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,750
You're very lucky.

517
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:56,916
Humpy!

518
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,166
Humpy!

519
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,541
Well, I'm off to bed.

520
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,375
You know your room, right?

521
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:10,000
Hey, Polo!

522
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,916
Thanks, buddy.

523
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:17,708
He is thanking me!

524
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:39,333
<i>Why just one song?</i>
<i>Compose a hundred songs.</i>

525
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:41,791
<i>Compose a hundred songs.</i>

526
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:03,833
<i>As time passed…</i>

527
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,625
<i>Jay began composing songs.</i>

528
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,375
<i>And slowly…</i>

529
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,750
<i>Shillong grew on him.</i>

530
00:41:56,333 --> 00:42:00,083
<i>And with each passing day,</i>
<i>with each song,</i>

531
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,166
<i>we were getting closer</i>

532
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,541
<i>to being together.</i>

533
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,541
<i>But then, all of a sudden,</i>

534
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,375
<i>his inspiration dried up.</i>

535
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,083
<i>A change was needed.</i>

536
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:31,458
-Let's go.
-Where?

537
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:34,125
Where are you taking me? Hey!

538
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:47,000
Red Mascara. It's one of the
finest jazz clubs in the country, man.

539
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:50,041
There are auditions going on inside.
You might get your inspiration here.

540
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:52,416
-Pearl Masters, bro.
-Polo!

541
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:54,250
-Chandi.
-Hey!

542
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:55,750
-Nice to meet you.
-I'm glad. Nice to meet you.

543
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:56,750
-You are…
-Jay.

544
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:58,791
-Jay, welcome to Shillong, bro.
-Thank you.

545
00:42:58,875 --> 00:42:59,791
Bijoy!

546
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,916
The drummer and the pianist.

547
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,541
-Oh, you are the Mumbai boys!
-Hi!

548
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,125
You guys are good.

549
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:08,500
But whether you are good enough or not

550
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:10,125
is for her to decide.

551
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:12,458
It all depends on your performance.

552
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:13,500
Good luck, guys!

553
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:14,625
Hello?

554
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,083
Let's do this!

555
00:43:26,666 --> 00:43:27,958
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

556
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,541
<i>give it up for Sheila,</i>

557
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:32,041
<i>the jazz queen of Shillong!</i>

558
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:36,875
<i>Let me tell you a story</i>

559
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:41,208
<i>A mad, fleeting love story</i>

560
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:44,833
<i>Can you tell me</i>

561
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:51,208
<i>How it will end?</i>

562
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:57,041
<i>You once promised me</i>

563
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:02,583
<i>That you would lay your head on my lap</i>

564
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:06,125
<i>And breathe your last</i>

565
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,833
<i>But today…</i>

566
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:16,125
<i>You are here with another woman</i>

567
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:21,416
<i>I say, it's foolishness</i>

568
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:24,333
<i>It is now time</i>

569
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:27,166
<i>To measure your love</i>

570
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:34,958
<i>Do you really love me?</i>

571
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:36,625
<i>Tell me</i>

572
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:44,458
<i>Don't you lie to me</i>
<i>Or I will burn you alive!</i>

573
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,208
<i>How deep is your love?</i>

574
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:56,083
<i>Do you really love me?</i>

575
00:44:57,083 --> 00:45:02,708
<i>Do you really love me?</i>

576
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:08,625
<i>Don't you lie</i>
<i>Or a bullet will pierce your heart</i>

577
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:12,666
<i>A bullet will pierce your heart</i>
<i>Tell me, do you love me?</i>

578
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:16,250
<i>Where did all your love go, my friend?</i>

579
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:19,875
<i>What about all the promises you made?</i>

580
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:23,250
<i>Tonight, you are here, my friend!</i>

581
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:28,125
<i>But where did all your love go?</i>

582
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:33,083
<i>Were those hugs and kisses</i>

583
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:36,666
<i>Not enough, my friend?</i>

584
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:40,666
<i>Tonight, there will be a shower of bullets</i>

585
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:45,083
<i>And not kisses!</i>

586
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:48,583
<i>So, tell me!</i>

587
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:52,041
<i>Out with it!</i>

588
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:58,041
<i>If you lie</i>
<i>A bullet will pierce your heart</i>

589
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:06,125
<i>Where did all your love go, my friend?</i>

590
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:09,583
<i>What about all the promises you made?</i>

591
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:13,625
<i>Tonight, you are here, my friend!</i>

592
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:17,000
<i>Where did all your love go, my friend?</i>

593
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:21,291
<i>Where did all your love go, my friend?</i>

594
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,416
That was good, right?

595
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:04,416
Hey, pianist!

596
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,125
She wants to see you.

597
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:15,875
-Do you have a cell phone?
-I do.

598
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:17,916
Put it on silent mode.

599
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,708
My phone is on silent mode.

600
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:27,916
So?

601
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:29,916
Won't she call me next?

602
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:35,500
Oh, God!

603
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:37,208
These kids, man!

604
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:51,125
So, you're the one in
search of a hundred songs!

605
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,708
-How do you know about that?
-Sit.

606
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:56,125
Everyone in Shillong knows about that.

607
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:57,791
Drink?

608
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,791
No, thank you. I don't drink.

609
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:05,416
And thank you for letting me

610
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,666
play as a part of your band.

611
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:19,625
-Why are you still here?
-I'm waiting for him.

612
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,125
Go home.

613
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:24,791
He'll be out only after
writing a hundred songs.

614
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:31,375
Do you play classical music?

615
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:34,750
For those who don't
know much about it, yes.

616
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:39,666
But I've never had the guts to play
for those who know classical music.

617
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:42,583
Jay, classical music is for people…

618
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:44,416
who like rules.

619
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:47,666
Jazz is for the living.

620
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:49,625
The fearless.

621
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,875
Do you want to be a composer?

622
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,666
Yes.

623
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,458
From where did you learn music?

624
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:16,250
Hey, Farukh!

625
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,416
Where the hell are you?

626
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:21,416
Timing is the mark of a good piano tuner.

627
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,583
Hey, come here!

628
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:26,333
Your father forbade you
from coming here, right?

629
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:27,458
Shall I call him now?

630
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:29,458
Did you forget what
happened the other day?

631
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,541
But I've come here as a customer.

632
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:32,791
Customer?

633
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:34,750
What do you want to buy?

634
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:39,375
How many music lessons
do you give per month?

635
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:41,708
Five lessons in a month.

636
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:43,916
How long is each lesson?

637
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,916
An hour long.

638
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,625
-What is this for?
-Fees for five minutes of a lesson.

639
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,250
Please ask him to teach me.

640
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:01,166
Go on.

641
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:34,583
<i>Daddy says music is a bad thing.</i>

642
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:37,958
<i>And I must stay away from it.</i>

643
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,416
Have you met Rahul?

644
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:47,958
I've been teaching him since he was ten.

645
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:51,125
He's blind.

646
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,125
But he's got wings.

647
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:54,833
Always remember,

648
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:58,708
feeling something is more important
than merely seeing something.

649
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:01,833
That's what music teaches us.

650
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:11,000
I'll take your leave now.
Tarun is waiting for me.

651
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,166
-Where are you going?
-For basketball practice.

652
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:16,708
So early in the morning?

653
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:19,583
Well, there's a tournament.

654
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:51,333
John, how many times should I call you?

655
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:54,291
Hey, John is very busy.

656
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:00,666
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Pops.

657
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:04,291
-"Aberrant"? What's that?
-It's a band from Shillong, Pop.

658
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:06,125
You know Imti, right?

659
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:07,666
Who's Imti?

660
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:09,291
Tell me one thing, Pops.

661
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:11,083
Why must you always pick on me?

662
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,750
Lona is here. Jay is here.

663
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,291
Lona has been practicing
piano all morning.

664
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:17,916
And your friend, Jay…
he has gone to the jazz club.

665
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:19,250
Do you know that?

666
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:21,333
And what are you doing? Oversleeping!

667
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:22,916
Jay has gone to Red Mascara?

668
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:25,500
Where else would he go?
You go back to sleep!

669
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:40,083
This is my father's collection.

670
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:45,208
Gershwin, Miller, Peterson.

671
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:49,583
The secrets of many jazz
greats are hidden here.

672
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:53,291
You can drop in…

673
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:55,333
anytime you want.

674
00:56:08,541 --> 00:56:10,208
Why just one song?

675
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:12,833
<i>Compose a hundred songs.</i>

676
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:26,750
What's the key?

677
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:29,625
E-Flat major.

678
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:31,500
Reharmonize it. Opening in E-flat,

679
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:34,250
1625 in B-flat.
Now, what can you add to it?

680
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:35,708
C-7 flat 9.

681
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:36,916
-F minor?
-Seven.

682
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:38,250
-B-flat?
-Seven.

683
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:39,791
-Or?
-Flat 9.

684
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:42,125
So, play the octaves by
the end full spread chords,

685
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:44,875
double the melody with your left hand.
G-flat diminished, E diminished.

686
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:47,333
B-flat with an F in the bass or F minor 7?

687
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:49,666
Tritone substitute B7 with a…

688
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,583
A sharp…

689
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,875
nine?

690
00:56:57,291 --> 00:57:00,375
Now, that's how you turn on a woman.

691
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:05,500
Play it!

692
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,166
I'm listening.

693
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:12,666
<i>Don't you know about Jay?</i>

694
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,250
<i>He's fully engrossed in music.</i>

695
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:18,250
Sophia, please don't cry.

696
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:21,791
You should come here.

697
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:24,041
Come here on Sunday.

698
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:25,916
<i>If you come here,</i>
<i>you can meet Humpy.</i>

699
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,916
<i>And it will be a big surprise for Jay.</i>

700
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:31,833
Just come here.

701
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:34,916
<i>-Everything will be fine.</i>
<i>-Polo!</i>

702
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:40,000
Okay, Sophia.

703
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,125
<i>I'll call you back in sometime.</i>

704
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,416
<i>Pops, where's the drum key?</i>

705
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:50,125
It's in the blue box.

706
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:54,541
How are you?

707
00:57:58,083 --> 00:57:59,458
Are you mad at me?

708
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:01,958
That was one week ago.

709
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:04,625
I just don't care anymore.

710
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:09,500
By the way, Sophia misses you a lot.

711
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,000
I miss her too.

712
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:16,083
Is that why you're
not answering her calls?

713
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:21,791
Don't you know I've been busy?

714
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,916
Sure, you've been busy…

715
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:30,208
with Sheila.

716
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:35,208
-What are you trying to say?
-Look.

717
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:37,375
I don't know the ways of the world,

718
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:39,541
but it's clear as day.

719
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:53,000
Here's another thing…

720
00:58:57,208 --> 00:58:58,583
Well, forget it.

721
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:06,041
<i>It is only for you</i>

722
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:09,333
<i>That my heart beats</i>

723
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:13,416
<i>But your heart</i>

724
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:17,375
<i>Now beats for someone else</i>

725
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:25,291
<i>Darling! Come back to me!</i>

726
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:29,250
<i>Let's not dwell</i>
<i>On the mistakes we've made</i>

727
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:35,375
<i>Let's forget the wounds of the past</i>

728
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:40,375
<i>Come, let's walk together again</i>

729
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:44,291
<i>Grasping the hand of the wind</i>

730
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:50,416
<i>Won't you tell me</i>
<i>How deep your love is?</i>

731
00:59:53,916 --> 00:59:58,583
<i>Do you really love me?</i>

732
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:06,416
<i>If you lie</i>
<i>I'll put a bullet through your heart</i>

733
01:00:07,666 --> 01:00:13,291
<i>Tell me that you love me</i>

734
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:18,541
<i>Do you really love me?</i>

735
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:24,333
<i>Do you really love me?</i>

736
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,208
<i>If you lie</i>
<i>I'll put a bullet through your heart</i>

737
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:32,625
<i>I'll put a bullet through your heart</i>

738
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,791
<i>I'll destroy you</i>

739
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:38,125
<i>Where did all your love go, my friend?</i>

740
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:41,791
<i>What about all the promises you made?</i>

741
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:45,666
<i>Tonight, you are here, my friend!</i>

742
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:50,041
<i>Where did all your love go, my friend?</i>

743
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:18,875
Amazing!

744
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:20,625
Wow!

745
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:22,333
You're a young sage, bro!

746
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:55,833
You seem to be practicing a lot!

747
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,291
That was just my anger…

748
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,916
but yours was sheer talent.

749
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:04,375
You've become a jazz drummer now.

750
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:08,625
Sure! A jazz drummer!

751
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,875
-What happened?
-It hurts.

752
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,833
Come on, man!

753
01:03:25,416 --> 01:03:26,666
What happened?

754
01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:28,583
Where are you going?

755
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:31,625
Polo!

756
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:38,708
Hi!

757
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:41,500
Janice.

758
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:43,375
Jay.

759
01:03:48,666 --> 01:03:49,666
What?

760
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,000
Show it to him.

761
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:01,458
You're getting married?

762
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:03,541
What an amazing performance, man!

763
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:05,125
-What a gig!
-Really? What a surprise!

764
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,916
-Awesome!
-Where were you guys?

765
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,666
Another one bites the dust, bro!

766
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:11,958
Hey! I'm so happy for you.

767
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:14,666
Come on! Group hug, guys!

768
01:04:31,541 --> 01:04:33,041
Hey! Strike a pose.

769
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:38,250
Where's Sheila?

770
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,083
I think we're gonna
head to Janice's house.

771
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:49,291
And if it gets late,

772
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,291
-I'll be meeting you later.
-Hey, Polo!

773
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:54,666
I'll call you back.

774
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:55,750
-Polo!
-Hey!

775
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:57,166
When did you come to Shillong?

776
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:00,000
You didn't come to see us, man.
Everyone was asking about you.

777
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:02,416
-How's it going?
-Same old stuff, man.

778
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,166
Puff!

779
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:06,166
Same old.

780
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:08,791
Let's have a party.
It's been quite some time.

781
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,666
Wait. We'll go.

782
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:14,000
I'm telling you, don't be late for dinner.

783
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:15,875
Please be there on time.

784
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:17,250
Do you understand? Come early.

785
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,166
-Please. Bring Polo along.
-Okay.

786
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,666
-Okay? Bye.
-Yeah.

787
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:26,375
Polo!

788
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:33,041
What are you doing here?

789
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:35,875
-I was looking for you.
-Me?

790
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:37,500
-Really?
-Yes.

791
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:39,041
Isn't this where you hang out?

792
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:43,916
So, you're getting married!

793
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,083
Come on, man!

794
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:51,041
-Miss you, bro.
-Same here.

795
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:54,333
Hey!

796
01:05:55,666 --> 01:05:56,791
Did you check them?

797
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:58,416
Come here.

798
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:00,500
-Come here!
-What's wrong, sir?

799
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:01,875
What is this?

800
01:06:02,666 --> 01:06:04,666
Put your hands up.
What have you got there?

801
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,458
-It's my wallet, sir.
-Turn around.

802
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:09,333
Check him.

803
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,625
Hey, you! Come here!

804
01:06:10,916 --> 01:06:12,458
Come here quickly!

805
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:14,541
Put your hands up.

806
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:18,708
What's this?

807
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,333
It's a phone, sir.

808
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,666
Move it!

809
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:25,291
Come on, move it!

810
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:29,500
Keep walking!

811
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:32,916
Go!

812
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,625
Keep walking.

813
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:40,416
We didn't find anything, sir.

814
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,500
Sir!

815
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:59,416
Do you want the drugs back?

816
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:01,208
You need the drugs?

817
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:02,500
Do you?

818
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:04,333
Take him away!

819
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:05,833
-Idiot!
-Move it!

820
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,416
-Hey!
-Polo!

821
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,666
Move!

822
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:12,291
Hey!

823
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:16,583
Bring him here.

824
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,541
Do you know him?

825
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:33,458
-No, sir.
-What about him?

826
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:35,541
He's an old friend, sir.

827
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:37,083
-Friend?
-Yes, sir.

828
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:39,125
These rogues are your friends?

829
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:42,916
Go.

830
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:50,625
Get going!

831
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,083
Miss Sheila.

832
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:09,125
Hey!

833
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:13,125
The police were here for a raid.

834
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:15,291
Really?

835
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:17,208
The party got canceled.

836
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:20,666
Everyone has left.

837
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:28,458
Hey, do you want to…

838
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:31,958
stay for coffee?

839
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,666
In such situations…

840
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:42,625
coffee doesn't really mean coffee.

841
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:47,583
No.

842
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:52,500
I really need some coffee.
I need to sober up.

843
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:56,333
So that you can drink again?

844
01:08:57,791 --> 01:08:59,291
Exactly!

845
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:29,875
Sir! Excuse me, sir!

846
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:33,458
We've been here for two hours!
Let us go home, please!

847
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:39,541
Hey, honey.

848
01:09:39,666 --> 01:09:41,750
Something unexpected has happened.

849
01:09:42,375 --> 01:09:43,791
I want you to sit down.

850
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:46,250
Take her bag inside.

851
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:49,958
Sit down, dear.
Take a deep breath.

852
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:52,250
Chandi, where are you?

853
01:09:53,458 --> 01:09:54,750
Who's at the club?

854
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:58,833
I want to know where Jay is!
He isn't answering my calls!

855
01:10:00,416 --> 01:10:01,750
Hey, come here!

856
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:07,625
Your name is Polo, right?

857
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:11,041
Do you know
what happened to your friend?

858
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:21,083
<i>I hate it when I'm right</i>

859
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,708
<i>about everything that's wrong.</i>

860
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:24,791
Well…

861
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:27,708
Arun.

862
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:31,375
I hate to be the one to say…

863
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:33,125
"I told you so."

864
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:21,333
<i>Life is all about…</i>

865
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:24,541
<i>distances and separations settling in.</i>

866
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:26,958
<i>And they often lead to…</i>

867
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,250
<i>horrible mistakes!</i>

868
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:17,916
Do you want one more?

869
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:30,583
Hey!

870
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,208
Is he conscious?

871
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:35,541
No, sir. He has taken drugs.

872
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,375
Do you want more?

873
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:53,041
Do you want more drugs?

874
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:09,750
Hey!

875
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:12,833
Music is a religion in Shillong.

876
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:15,708
And it has no place for people like you.

877
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:26,750
<i>There used to be some magic…</i>

878
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:28,958
<i>between us.</i>

879
01:15:30,166 --> 01:15:31,583
<i>But now…</i>

880
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:33,750
<i>only silence remains.</i>

881
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:08,041
Methamphetamine.

882
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:10,916
Do you know what that is?

883
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:14,125
Do you know what crystal meth is?

884
01:16:15,208 --> 01:16:17,875
There was so much crystal meth
in your friend's blood.

885
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:21,375
Forget driving, he shouldn't
have been let out of the house.

886
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:27,125
-Still, he was out with Sheila.
-Jay isn't like that.

887
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:28,666
He's clean.

888
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,750
So, is this report wrong?

889
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,708
How did crystal meth get into his blood?

890
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,416
Because of me.

891
01:16:43,458 --> 01:16:45,750
-Hey, Polo!
-Dude!

892
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:47,375
Let's party tonight.

893
01:16:47,458 --> 01:16:49,750
-There's a party going on.
-You call this a party?

894
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:51,708
You're getting married, man!

895
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:54,541
I'm talking about acid.
I have even got MD.

896
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:56,416
I've also got a surprise for you.

897
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:59,583
-Hey!
-Do you remember me?

898
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:01,833
-Do you know him?
-No, sir.

899
01:17:03,666 --> 01:17:05,791
This is Shillong, Polo!

900
01:17:05,916 --> 01:17:07,958
Hey! Come on, guys!

901
01:17:24,083 --> 01:17:25,250
Polo!

902
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:29,708
Turn around.

903
01:17:36,541 --> 01:17:38,208
Hey, do you want to…

904
01:17:38,333 --> 01:17:39,833
stay for coffee?

905
01:17:57,875 --> 01:17:59,458
Chandi, where are you?

906
01:17:59,916 --> 01:18:02,750
I want to know where Jay is!
He isn't answering my calls!

907
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:08,458
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

908
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:11,125
You poisoned your close friend!

909
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:15,541
Do you even know the effects
of such a high dose?

910
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,458
Psychosis.

911
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,166
Seizures.

912
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:21,666
Brain hemorrhage.

913
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:25,166
I cannot save your friend.

914
01:18:27,458 --> 01:18:30,416
Please… please, sir.

915
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,333
There's only one option.

916
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,583
We could declare that…

917
01:18:58,416 --> 01:18:59,708
he is an addict.

918
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,125
He'll be sent to rehab.

919
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:04,208
There, he'd have to serve the full term

920
01:19:05,166 --> 01:19:06,625
and undergo treatment as well.

921
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:08,958
Rehab is better than jail.

922
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:13,541
I will send a lawyer.

923
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:15,291
I hope you can afford him.

924
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:19,916
I really can't believe
that you're Khagen's son.

925
01:19:31,208 --> 01:19:33,291
We treat all kinds of addicts here.

926
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:35,875
Get room no. 208 ready.
The patient is on his way.

927
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:48,541
We understand very well…

928
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
addiction is not merely substance abuse.

929
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:52,750
It's an illness.

930
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,291
Fill up this visitors' form.

931
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,166
You'll get a date to see him.

932
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,500
The canteen closes at 7:30 p.m. sharp.

933
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:04,041
No sleeping on the premises.

934
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,333
<i>Why me?</i>

935
01:20:11,416 --> 01:20:13,375
<i>Why? What have I done?</i>

936
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:15,041
What have I done?

937
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:17,375
Why is this happening to me? Why?

938
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:19,000
Why me?

939
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:20,166
<i>Why me?</i>

940
01:20:20,291 --> 01:20:21,625
<i>What have I done?</i>

941
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:25,583
What have I done?

942
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:52,250
<i>I didn't ask for this</i>

943
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:58,291
<i>I didn't wish to endure this!</i>

944
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:04,375
<i>Why am I going through this ordeal?</i>

945
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:10,291
<i>What am I paying the price for?</i>

946
01:21:11,625 --> 01:21:17,791
<i>There's a volcano in my heart</i>

947
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:23,791
<i>There's a volcano in my eyes</i>

948
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:31,083
<i>There's a volcano within me</i>

949
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:37,666
<i>Why did you make it erupt, love?</i>

950
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:50,041
Love has turned her head.

951
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:52,250
<i>Keep an eye on her.</i>

952
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:55,708
Got it.

953
01:21:55,791 --> 01:22:01,750
<i>I am not myself anymore</i>
<i>This isn't who I used to be</i>

954
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:04,666
<i>Without him</i>

955
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:07,666
<i>The skies are Grey</i>

956
01:22:07,791 --> 01:22:13,291
<i>Why doesn't the wind lie to me?</i>

957
01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:19,250
<i>Whatever happened to the truth?</i>
<i>Is change really inevitable?</i>

958
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:22,875
Does this have to end in tears?

959
01:22:22,958 --> 01:22:26,125
<i>Will I burn to ashes in your fire?</i>

960
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:30,791
<i>What will transpire?</i>

961
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:38,583
<i>There's a volcano in my heart</i>

962
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:44,750
<i>There's a volcano in my eyes</i>

963
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:51,750
<i>There's a volcano within me</i>

964
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:57,166
<i>Why did you make it erupt, love?</i>

965
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:20,916
<i>Oh, volcano!</i>

966
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,500
<i>Where are you?</i>

967
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:29,958
<i>Oh, volcano!</i>

968
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:43,625
<i>Oh, volcano!</i>

969
01:23:44,666 --> 01:23:48,958
<i>Oh, volcano!</i>

970
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:55,041
<i>The Grey skies make me numb</i>

971
01:23:55,458 --> 01:24:01,125
<i>What has my life come to?</i>

972
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:07,083
<i>All my tears have dried up</i>
<i>There's a void in me</i>

973
01:24:07,416 --> 01:24:12,125
<i>Hold me in a warm embrace</i>
<i>And fix me up</i>

974
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,750
<i>Oh, volcano!</i>

975
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,416
<i>Oh, volcano!</i>

976
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:25,125
<i>There's a volcano in my heart</i>

977
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:30,375
<i>There's a volcano in my eyes</i>

978
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:38,583
<i>There's a volcano within me</i>

979
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:44,791
<i>Why did you make it erupt, love?</i>

980
01:25:09,916 --> 01:25:11,208
I know everything.

981
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:13,416
I've been watching you.

982
01:25:14,458 --> 01:25:17,291
When a wedding procession
goes by, you run to the window.

983
01:25:17,958 --> 01:25:20,750
When you hear a flute seller's
tune, you run to the window.

984
01:25:20,833 --> 01:25:24,083
You slyly listen to
our neighbors chanting prayers.

985
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:27,041
How many times have I told you?

986
01:25:27,833 --> 01:25:29,791
You got a beating last time, remember?

987
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,166
Did you like that?

988
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:36,541
It hurts me as well.
So, why do you still do such things?

989
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:44,458
Music has ruined our family.

990
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:47,291
It's taken everything from us.

991
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:50,666
Don't make the same mistake I made.

992
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,041
Stay away from it.

993
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:56,375
Understood?

994
01:25:58,666 --> 01:25:59,958
Do you promise?

995
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,458
<i>I canceled my wedding.</i>

996
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:25,458
<i>I had no idea things would turn so bad.</i>

997
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:30,375
<i>I know it was all my fault.</i>

998
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:31,833
<i>No.</i>

999
01:26:32,041 --> 01:26:34,166
It's not your fault. It's mine.

1000
01:26:37,166 --> 01:26:38,458
I was warned…

1001
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:40,791
by my father.

1002
01:26:43,791 --> 01:26:44,916
But…

1003
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,375
I deceived him.

1004
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:54,875
I learned music without his knowledge.

1005
01:26:58,166 --> 01:26:59,875
And look where music has got me!

1006
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:06,333
It's an addiction.

1007
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,750
I told you, music is an addiction.

1008
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:13,000
Now, look…

1009
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:16,875
Look what that addiction as done to me.

1010
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:20,208
I'm being treated now.

1011
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:23,333
Perhaps I wasn't made for music.

1012
01:27:24,208 --> 01:27:25,500
Hey!

1013
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:29,916
-Look at me.
-Dad was right.

1014
01:27:30,583 --> 01:27:31,750
Look at me.

1015
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:36,250
Please… don't say such things.

1016
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,125
I've spoken to all the judges.

1017
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:42,208
The band members have
given good testimonies for you.

1018
01:27:43,041 --> 01:27:44,875
Everything will be fine.

1019
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:11,833
Everybody has a desire in life.

1020
01:28:11,916 --> 01:28:14,166
For some, desire becomes
the purpose of their lives.

1021
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:17,958
But for the others,
those desires remain desires forever.

1022
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:23,291
People must turn their desires
into goals and achieve it.

1023
01:28:27,291 --> 01:28:29,125
There used to be a saint.

1024
01:28:31,833 --> 01:28:35,458
<i>They say, he fell in</i>
<i>love with a courtesan.</i>

1025
01:28:35,541 --> 01:28:39,708
<i>But the courtesan spurned him.</i>

1026
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:44,833
<i>She said to him, "Why live in</i>
<i>the confined cage of desires?</i>

1027
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:49,250
<i>If you wish to,</i>
<i>you can fly in the open skies.</i>

1028
01:28:49,375 --> 01:28:51,708
<i>You can reach the highest peaks</i>

1029
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,875
<i>that we were born to touch."</i>

1030
01:28:57,333 --> 01:28:59,375
<i>He wept profusely.</i>

1031
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:02,291
<i>He put his eyes out.</i>

1032
01:29:03,791 --> 01:29:07,166
<i>And his love turned into devotion.</i>

1033
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:11,791
<i>It turned into a thousand</i>
<i>songs and poems.</i>

1034
01:29:11,875 --> 01:29:12,750
PRIDE

1035
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:16,208
<i>He now lives in the hearts</i>
<i>of millions of people.</i>

1036
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,583
<i>The path of truth</i>

1037
01:29:23,666 --> 01:29:25,541
<i>is strewn with obstacles.</i>

1038
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:31,458
But no matter how hard the journey is,

1039
01:29:31,875 --> 01:29:34,708
we must be persistent and walk the path.

1040
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:36,666
The ones who live a complete life

1041
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:38,833
wouldn't need another birth.

1042
01:29:39,166 --> 01:29:40,666
There's a light within us,

1043
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:42,333
and we must awaken it.

1044
01:29:42,958 --> 01:29:44,833
That light must be shared

1045
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:48,291
with the other lamps
which are turned off.

1046
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:53,208
You ought to share the light
to brighten up others' lives.

1047
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:56,958
The path of truth will always be hard.

1048
01:29:57,291 --> 01:30:00,291
<i>But still, only the path of truth</i>

1049
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:02,416
<i>will help us accomplish our goals in life.</i>

1050
01:30:12,333 --> 01:30:13,958
Sophie!

1051
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:16,500
Sophie!

1052
01:30:25,375 --> 01:30:26,875
You're welcome!

1053
01:30:30,791 --> 01:30:36,791
<i>Oh, volcano!</i>
<i>Where are you</i>

1054
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:43,208
<i>Oh, volcano!</i>

1055
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:57,333
<i>Oh, volcano!</i>

1056
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,000
<i>Oh, volcano!</i>

1057
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:07,791
<i>My world has turned upside down</i>

1058
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:14,041
<i>What has my life come to?</i>

1059
01:31:16,958 --> 01:31:18,791
<i>Today…</i>

1060
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:22,750
<i>I feel like screaming at death.</i>

1061
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:25,541
<i>Death!</i>

1062
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:29,000
<i>It is so close to me.</i>

1063
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:33,250
<i>Now, only death can…</i>

1064
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:37,041
<i>heal all my wounds.</i>

1065
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:03,500
<i>How is it possible?</i>

1066
01:32:28,166 --> 01:32:29,625
<i>This is not my Jay.</i>

1067
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:44,583
<i>He threw it all away.</i>

1068
01:33:48,875 --> 01:33:50,125
<i>His dreams.</i>

1069
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:51,500
<i>His goals.</i>

1070
01:33:52,583 --> 01:33:53,750
<i>His songs.</i>

1071
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,625
<i>My songs.</i>

1072
01:33:56,083 --> 01:33:57,416
<i>Everything.</i>

1073
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:14,458
<i>There was nothing left in him.</i>

1074
01:34:18,291 --> 01:34:20,000
<i>Not even life.</i>

1075
01:36:58,791 --> 01:37:00,833
You have a very interesting story.

1076
01:37:02,791 --> 01:37:04,708
You were in search of a hundred songs,

1077
01:37:04,875 --> 01:37:07,208
but you slipped into an abyss.

1078
01:37:08,541 --> 01:37:09,833
But you're lucky…

1079
01:37:11,041 --> 01:37:12,750
you still have those songs within you.

1080
01:37:16,083 --> 01:37:17,375
I'm empty from within.

1081
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:20,958
A song…

1082
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:24,208
can never be separated from its creator.

1083
01:37:28,625 --> 01:37:30,416
Music has greater strength…

1084
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:34,000
than words and thoughts.

1085
01:37:36,875 --> 01:37:38,833
Music is the last bit of magic…

1086
01:37:39,875 --> 01:37:42,708
left in this world.

1087
01:37:47,791 --> 01:37:49,458
You should believe in it.

1088
01:38:40,875 --> 01:38:43,875
I've waited many years for this moment.

1089
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:15,250
That's your mother.

1090
01:39:18,916 --> 01:39:20,958
<i>Yes, she's your mother.</i>

1091
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:29,125
<i>O Lord of supreme beauty!</i>

1092
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:35,625
<i>O revered Sai!</i>

1093
01:39:35,916 --> 01:39:39,000
<i>Your mother had a divine voice</i>
<i>which could mesmerize everyone.</i>

1094
01:39:39,083 --> 01:39:44,541
<i>Would you become the light of my life?</i>

1095
01:39:44,875 --> 01:39:47,541
<i>Your father fell in love</i>
<i>the moment he heard her sing.</i>

1096
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:53,000
<i>Look at my pitiable state</i>

1097
01:39:54,041 --> 01:39:59,333
<i>I bow down to You, O Lord</i>

1098
01:39:59,416 --> 01:40:05,375
<i>O revered Sai!</i>

1099
01:40:06,708 --> 01:40:09,458
<i>But your father was already engaged…</i>

1100
01:40:12,041 --> 01:40:13,416
<i>to his boss' daughter.</i>

1101
01:40:26,666 --> 01:40:30,375
<i>O Lord of divine beauty!</i>

1102
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:33,791
<i>Wouldn't You come to me?</i>

1103
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:40,416
<i>Would You become the light of my life?</i>

1104
01:40:42,208 --> 01:40:47,791
<i>Would you become</i>
<i>The language of love, O Lord</i>

1105
01:40:48,416 --> 01:40:54,416
<i>O my dear Sai!</i>

1106
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:59,500
<i>O Sai!</i>

1107
01:40:59,583 --> 01:41:03,583
<i>I long for a glimpse of You</i>

1108
01:41:03,666 --> 01:41:06,833
<i>O Lord of Shirdi</i>

1109
01:41:06,916 --> 01:41:10,916
<i>He is the rhythm of my pulse</i>

1110
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,416
<i>O Sai!</i>

1111
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:19,583
<i>Would You comfort my yearning soul?</i>

1112
01:41:22,125 --> 01:41:25,791
<i>O Lord of Shirdi</i>

1113
01:41:25,875 --> 01:41:29,083
<i>The Lord of this timid soul</i>

1114
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:32,583
<i>When your father's fiancee</i>
<i>found out that he loved someone else,</i>

1115
01:41:32,666 --> 01:41:34,166
<i>she could not bear it.</i>

1116
01:41:34,291 --> 01:41:36,500
<i>Their wedding was called off.</i>

1117
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:05,791
<i>O my dear Sai!</i>

1118
01:42:06,916 --> 01:42:10,583
<i>You are the symphony of my soul</i>

1119
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:16,083
<i>You mean the world to me</i>

1120
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,750
<i>You are the symphony of my soul</i>

1121
01:42:21,833 --> 01:42:25,625
<i>You mean the world to me</i>

1122
01:42:25,708 --> 01:42:28,625
<i>You are my guide</i>

1123
01:42:28,708 --> 01:42:32,791
<i>O revered Sai!</i>

1124
01:42:32,916 --> 01:42:36,583
<i>Your blessing is all I need</i>

1125
01:42:36,708 --> 01:42:40,041
<i>You are a sea of divine ecstasy, Sai!</i>

1126
01:42:40,125 --> 01:42:42,250
While your mother's success

1127
01:42:43,166 --> 01:42:45,625
was scaling new heights…

1128
01:42:47,041 --> 01:42:50,250
your father's business was collapsing.

1129
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:53,250
<i>I long for a glimpse of You</i>

1130
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:56,291
<i>O Lord of Shirdi</i>

1131
01:42:56,500 --> 01:43:00,583
<i>You are the rhythm of my pulse</i>

1132
01:43:00,916 --> 01:43:04,583
<i>O Lord of divine beauty!</i>

1133
01:43:04,666 --> 01:43:08,000
<i>Wouldn't You come to me?</i>

1134
01:43:08,083 --> 01:43:10,375
She sings so well.

1135
01:43:10,791 --> 01:43:15,500
<i>Would You become the light of my life?</i>

1136
01:43:16,083 --> 01:43:20,291
<i>Bestow me with Your blessings</i>

1137
01:43:20,416 --> 01:43:22,666
<i>As days passed,</i>
<i>resentment slowly grew</i>

1138
01:43:22,791 --> 01:43:24,416
<i>in your father's heart.</i>

1139
01:43:24,916 --> 01:43:30,333
<i>O Sai!</i>
<i>I long for a glimpse of You</i>

1140
01:43:30,458 --> 01:43:33,666
<i>O Lord of Shirdi</i>

1141
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:37,833
<i>You are the rhythm of my pulse</i>

1142
01:43:37,916 --> 01:43:41,250
<i>O Sai!</i>

1143
01:43:41,333 --> 01:43:46,166
<i>What shortcomings of mine</i>
<i>Hold me from your divine gaze?</i>

1144
01:43:48,916 --> 01:43:54,208
<i>O Sai!</i>
<i>Would Your grace be upon me?</i>

1145
01:43:54,458 --> 01:43:57,583
Congratulations, brother!
This is great news!

1146
01:43:57,750 --> 01:43:58,833
She needs to rest.

1147
01:43:59,375 --> 01:44:00,583
No more shows from now on.

1148
01:44:00,666 --> 01:44:02,833
<i>He forbade her from singing.</i>

1149
01:44:03,416 --> 01:44:09,416
<i>O Lord of Shirdi</i>

1150
01:44:11,583 --> 01:44:15,000
<i>My dear Lord</i>

1151
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:19,875
<i>Of divine love</i>

1152
01:44:22,458 --> 01:44:24,750
You look lovely. Stay well.

1153
01:44:27,125 --> 01:44:28,375
Brother!

1154
01:44:28,583 --> 01:44:30,583
We got a call from the President's office.

1155
01:44:30,666 --> 01:44:32,041
They've invited her to sing.

1156
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:33,958
What do you think?

1157
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:37,166
Tell them she won't make it.

1158
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:40,291
-But--
-You shouldn't even have asked me this.

1159
01:44:42,375 --> 01:44:43,958
<i>Soon enough,</i>

1160
01:44:44,208 --> 01:44:46,250
<i>he started imposing</i>
<i>more restrictions on her.</i>

1161
01:44:46,333 --> 01:44:48,500
<i>He forbade her from singing.</i>

1162
01:44:50,041 --> 01:44:51,958
<i>He was under the illusion</i>

1163
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:54,541
<i>that music is the cause of his ruins.</i>

1164
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,041
<i>That became his belief.</i>

1165
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,916
<i>Your mother eventually gave up singing.</i>

1166
01:45:05,208 --> 01:45:08,000
<i>But sometimes, she'd sing to you…</i>

1167
01:45:08,791 --> 01:45:12,166
<i>hoping that the tune would</i>
<i>reach you inside the womb.</i>

1168
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:16,208
<i>May you sound like Lord Krishna's flute</i>

1169
01:45:16,291 --> 01:45:19,916
<i>With the belief that it will be</i>
<i>etched in your heart and mind.</i>

1170
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,333
<i>You are my prayer that has been answered</i>

1171
01:45:23,458 --> 01:45:28,500
<i>You are the blessing</i>
<i>I have yearned for</i>

1172
01:45:28,625 --> 01:45:33,916
<i>You are my beloved song</i>

1173
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:39,041
<i>-Under the blue skies</i>
<i>-Under the blue skies</i>

1174
01:45:39,666 --> 01:45:44,583
-Your eyes shine
-Your eyes shine

1175
01:45:44,791 --> 01:45:49,625
-In the depths of the ocean
-In the depths of the ocean

1176
01:46:14,833 --> 01:46:16,583
You don't care about me, right?

1177
01:46:18,166 --> 01:46:20,333
I asked only one thing from you!

1178
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:26,916
Why?

1179
01:46:27,166 --> 01:46:29,208
How dare you sing!

1180
01:46:32,375 --> 01:46:36,833
I forbade you from singing, right?
There will be no singing in this house!

1181
01:46:36,916 --> 01:46:38,791
It must stop right now!

1182
01:46:38,875 --> 01:46:41,041
There will be no more music!

1183
01:46:49,791 --> 01:46:52,875
Don't you dare sing ever again!

1184
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,041
You will never sing again!

1185
01:47:29,958 --> 01:47:34,916
<i>As soon as you were born,</i>
<i>your father banished me.</i>

1186
01:47:40,958 --> 01:47:44,500
<i>But I had promised your mother</i>

1187
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,166
<i>that I'd always watch over you.</i>

1188
01:47:47,291 --> 01:47:49,250
<i>Come what may.</i>

1189
01:47:57,416 --> 01:47:58,958
Look at this.

1190
01:48:01,041 --> 01:48:03,250
You can still see her fingers

1191
01:48:03,333 --> 01:48:05,208
playing a tune.

1192
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:15,791
You have your mother's eyes.

1193
01:48:21,041 --> 01:48:23,000
It feels as though she's here…

1194
01:48:23,666 --> 01:48:25,666
in front of me.

1195
01:49:25,291 --> 01:49:27,000
Is everything in order?

1196
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:10,583
So, what now?

1197
01:50:16,708 --> 01:50:18,416
There's a tune in my mind.

1198
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:20,916
Can I finish it?

1199
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:25,041
Now?

1200
01:50:26,083 --> 01:50:27,208
Here?

1201
01:50:37,083 --> 01:50:41,333
<i>And of course, standing with them across</i>
<i>the border, across the Line of Control.</i>

1202
01:50:41,416 --> 01:50:42,875
<i>That's really the first point.</i>

1203
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,625
<i>The second point is…</i>

1204
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:46,375
-Sir.
-I have to give something to him.

1205
01:50:46,458 --> 01:50:47,875
He's on air.

1206
01:50:51,291 --> 01:50:52,708
Sir, your name?

1207
01:50:52,791 --> 01:50:54,083
Just give this to him.

1208
01:50:56,083 --> 01:50:58,333
-Whom should I say it is from?
-An old friend.

1209
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,916
- Hey, Mahesh!
- Yes, sir?

1210
01:51:04,708 --> 01:51:06,041
Where did this come from?

1211
01:51:06,208 --> 01:51:08,708
-Someone left it here, sir.
-Who did?

1212
01:51:09,291 --> 01:51:11,208
He said he was an old friend of yours.

1213
01:51:26,583 --> 01:51:28,916
And welcome to "Roll with…

1214
01:51:31,083 --> 01:51:32,458
Ricky!"

1215
01:51:32,541 --> 01:51:35,041
<i>We play India's superhit songs for you</i>

1216
01:51:35,125 --> 01:51:36,791
<i>right here.</i>

1217
01:51:37,083 --> 01:51:38,333
But today's different.

1218
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:42,708
An envelope with a pen drive
was dropped at my studio this morning.

1219
01:51:43,166 --> 01:51:45,375
It had only one song on it.

1220
01:51:46,625 --> 01:51:49,750
We don't know the composer's name.
We don't know who has written it.

1221
01:51:49,833 --> 01:51:51,500
There was just one song.

1222
01:51:52,250 --> 01:51:56,416
So, listeners!
Get ready to get your minds blown away!

1223
01:52:05,416 --> 01:52:11,416
<i>In a world with thousands of rainbows</i>

1224
01:52:12,375 --> 01:52:18,375
<i>Your eyes search for darkness</i>

1225
01:52:19,208 --> 01:52:25,083
<i>The fragrance of flowers</i>
<i>Is widespread in the world</i>

1226
01:52:25,166 --> 01:52:26,250
Turn up the volume.

1227
01:52:26,333 --> 01:52:32,333
<i>Yet your love is on a temporary fence</i>
<i>That holds a flower</i>

1228
01:52:32,583 --> 01:52:38,583
<i>For your heart to shine bright</i>

1229
01:52:39,333 --> 01:52:43,416
<i>You have to let inside</i>

1230
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:46,166
<i>The divine light</i>

1231
01:52:46,750 --> 01:52:49,500
<i>All they sent was a pen drive</i>
<i>with one song on it.</i>

1232
01:52:49,583 --> 01:52:53,333
<i>Everyone's hooked on this song.</i>
<i>It belongs to someone anonymous.</i>

1233
01:52:53,416 --> 01:52:59,416
<i>Oh, noise! Turn to silence</i>

1234
01:53:00,291 --> 01:53:06,208
<i>Oh, deception! Turn into goodness</i>

1235
01:53:07,208 --> 01:53:13,625
<i>Oh, greed! Turn into charity</i>

1236
01:53:14,041 --> 01:53:20,041
<i>Oh, nothingness!</i>
<i>Fill up the void in my life</i>

1237
01:53:20,666 --> 01:53:26,625
<i>For your heart to shine bright</i>

1238
01:53:27,375 --> 01:53:33,333
<i>You have to let inside</i>
<i>The divine light</i>

1239
01:53:34,041 --> 01:53:38,000
<i>They have just recorded</i>
<i>the song and sent it over.</i>

1240
01:53:38,083 --> 01:53:41,333
<i>But no one knows whose it is</i>
<i>or where it's from.</i>

1241
01:53:41,416 --> 01:53:43,958
<i>Cut off a tree's branch</i>

1242
01:53:44,041 --> 01:53:48,041
<i>And yet, it will give you flowers</i>

1243
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:50,750
<i>Step over a boat</i>

1244
01:53:50,833 --> 01:53:54,833
<i>And yet, it holds you safe</i>

1245
01:53:55,041 --> 01:53:57,750
<i>Beat the drum</i>

1246
01:53:57,833 --> 01:54:01,750
<i>And yet, it gives you music</i>

1247
01:54:02,041 --> 01:54:08,041
<i>That's just how pure a mother's love is</i>

1248
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:14,625
<i>For your heart to shine bright</i>

1249
01:54:15,291 --> 01:54:19,750
<i>You have to let inside</i>

1250
01:54:19,833 --> 01:54:22,166
<i>The divine light</i>

1251
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:28,208
<i>Let your heart shine bright</i>

1252
01:54:28,958 --> 01:54:32,708
<i>And just as it shines brighter</i>

1253
01:54:32,791 --> 01:54:36,208
<i>Humanity will drink up its light</i>

1254
01:54:46,416 --> 01:54:48,000
<i>As far back as he could remember…</i>

1255
01:54:49,458 --> 01:54:54,250
<i>his mind had been haunted by a tune.</i>

1256
01:54:55,875 --> 01:54:58,541
<i>Your mother eventually gave up singing.</i>

1257
01:54:59,083 --> 01:55:01,875
<i>But sometimes, she'd sing to you…</i>

1258
01:55:02,125 --> 01:55:06,875
<i>hoping that the tune would</i>
<i>reach you inside the womb.</i>

1259
01:55:31,083 --> 01:55:34,416
<i>Oh, Mother!</i>

1260
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:37,833
<i>To lay on your lap is all I want!</i>

1261
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:44,000
<i>You are my ultimate blessing</i>

1262
01:55:44,833 --> 01:55:48,208
<i>You gave me everything</i>

1263
01:55:48,291 --> 01:55:51,583
<i>You are always there by my side</i>

1264
01:55:51,666 --> 01:55:54,875
<i>You will live within me forever</i>

1265
01:55:54,958 --> 01:55:58,416
<i>Shower your blessings on me</i>

1266
01:55:58,541 --> 01:56:01,833
<i>My life belongs to you</i>

1267
01:56:01,916 --> 01:56:07,291
<i>My soul is a part of you</i>

1268
01:56:08,333 --> 01:56:10,416
<i>Oh, mother!</i>

1269
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:16,041
<i>How will I ever repay you?</i>

1270
01:56:32,916 --> 01:56:38,916
<i>In a world with thousands of rainbows</i>

1271
01:56:39,791 --> 01:56:45,791
<i>Your eyes search for darkness</i>

1272
01:56:46,625 --> 01:56:52,583
<i>The fragrance of flowers</i>
<i>Is widespread in the world</i>

1273
01:56:53,375 --> 01:56:59,375
<i>Yet your love is on a temporary fence</i>
<i>That holds a flower</i>

1274
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:06,000
<i>For your heart to shine bright</i>

1275
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:10,500
<i>You have to let inside</i>

1276
01:57:10,583 --> 01:57:13,416
<i>The divine light</i>

1277
01:57:13,833 --> 01:57:17,416
<i>For your heart</i>

1278
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:20,375
<i>To shine bright</i>

1279
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:24,250
<i>You have to let inside</i>

1280
01:57:24,333 --> 01:57:26,875
<i>The divine light</i>

1281
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:54,041
Mr. Prabhakar.

1282
01:57:54,125 --> 01:57:55,458
Ready when you are.

1283
01:58:01,791 --> 01:58:04,291
<i>This morning,</i>
<i>Chief Minister Ashwath Prabhakar</i>

1284
01:58:04,375 --> 01:58:05,916
<i>posted a link online</i>

1285
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,833
<i>with the names of many</i>
<i>eminent personalities.</i>

1286
01:58:07,916 --> 01:58:11,291
<i>The names of those who are involved in</i>
<i>corruption and illegal weapon businesses</i>

1287
01:58:11,375 --> 01:58:13,000
<i>have been made public.</i>

1288
01:58:13,166 --> 01:58:15,708
<i>The list includes 115 MLAs,</i>

1289
01:58:15,833 --> 01:58:17,208
<i>CMs of five states,</i>

1290
01:58:17,333 --> 01:58:19,000
<i>and oil company directors.</i>

1291
01:58:19,083 --> 01:58:21,083
<i>Their contracts and emails</i>

1292
01:58:21,166 --> 01:58:23,125
<i>have also been posted online.</i>

1293
01:58:23,208 --> 01:58:25,708
<i>The corruption of the politicians</i>
<i>is out in the open.</i>

1294
01:58:26,083 --> 01:58:28,416
<i>I should have died in that car crash.</i>

1295
01:58:30,041 --> 01:58:32,041
<i>But even death spurned me.</i>

1296
01:58:34,083 --> 01:58:36,625
<i>Just that one song kept</i>
<i>playing in my head.</i>

1297
01:58:43,083 --> 01:58:46,000
Money and authority…
are these the only things that matter?

1298
01:58:48,041 --> 01:58:49,333
<i>A song?</i>

1299
01:58:49,541 --> 01:58:52,000
That song has changed me.

1300
01:58:52,708 --> 01:58:54,416
<i>And only a song can do that.</i>

1301
01:58:55,208 --> 01:58:57,750
<i>That's why countries</i>
<i>have a national anthem,</i>

1302
01:58:57,916 --> 01:58:59,583
<i>not a national speech.</i>

1303
01:59:00,416 --> 01:59:03,833
<i>Only music with sheer purity</i>
<i>has the power to move you.</i>

1304
01:59:05,333 --> 01:59:07,583
What have you done, Prabhakar!

1305
01:59:10,166 --> 01:59:13,625
Music either reflects
reality or it doesn't.

1306
01:59:13,875 --> 01:59:15,458
Your music is good.

1307
01:59:15,583 --> 01:59:17,416
It will also reflect reality someday.

1308
01:59:22,166 --> 01:59:23,958
Did this song have that reality?

1309
01:59:25,583 --> 01:59:27,208
It showed me the reality.

1310
01:59:30,958 --> 01:59:32,666
It changed my whole world.

1311
01:59:34,041 --> 01:59:35,541
{\an8}<i>And now, news from India.</i>

1312
01:59:35,791 --> 01:59:37,500
{\an8}<i>A song at the heart of a revolution.</i>

1313
01:59:37,583 --> 01:59:40,208
{\an8}<i>An eminent politician in India</i>
<i>has done something remarkable</i>

1314
01:59:40,291 --> 01:59:41,500
{\an8}<i>by turning whistle blower</i>

1315
01:59:41,583 --> 01:59:43,416
{\an8}<i>-after a near-death experience.</i>
<i>-Chief Minister…</i>

1316
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:46,541
{\an8}<i>Ashwath Prabhakar in the union.</i>

1317
01:59:46,625 --> 01:59:49,083
{\an8}<i>A song was being played</i>
<i>on the radio during the protest,</i>

1318
01:59:49,166 --> 01:59:51,666
{\an8}<i>which is considered</i>
<i>to be the reason for change.</i>

1319
02:00:14,958 --> 02:00:19,666
<i>A song by an anonymous composer</i>
<i>has brought a change in the world.</i>

1320
02:01:03,708 --> 02:01:07,791
<i>He craved neither applause nor fame.</i>

1321
02:01:11,708 --> 02:01:13,291
<i>He wasn't filled with self-love.</i>

1322
02:01:14,083 --> 02:01:16,750
<i>Nor was he proud of having</i>
<i>written a hundred songs.</i>

1323
02:01:18,375 --> 02:01:19,875
<i>There was just one thing</i>

1324
02:01:20,666 --> 02:01:22,208
<i>that he wanted.</i>

1325
02:01:23,125 --> 02:01:24,750
<i>He wanted to return home.</i>

1326
02:01:27,208 --> 02:01:29,250
<i>Because his true home…</i>

1327
02:01:30,833 --> 02:01:32,291
<i>was music!</i>

1328
02:01:36,375 --> 02:01:37,750
<i>And in music,</i>

1329
02:01:38,250 --> 02:01:40,208
<i>he'd be protected forever.</i>

1330
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,083
<i>As far as he could remember,</i>

1331
02:02:57,250 --> 02:03:01,708
<i>he was haunted by a tune.</i>

1332
02:03:03,083 --> 02:03:06,166
<i>An untouched…</i>

1333
02:03:06,750 --> 02:03:08,583
<i>unspoken light…</i>

1334
02:03:10,083 --> 02:03:11,458
<i>that tore through</i>

1335
02:03:12,083 --> 02:03:13,541
<i>all the darkness.</i>
